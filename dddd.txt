Define
In the first step we work together with you to define vision, scope and basic functionality of the web site or application.

Design
We work closely with you to build user interface, visual content, hierarchy, etc. All designs are created fully responsive across all viewing devices.

Develop
Our design concepts and solutions come to life. Project is beta tested and agreed with you to meet all your feedbacks to the functionality.

Deploy
This is the final phase of the project, where your website or application goes to user testing and finally, launch.
